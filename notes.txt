it is possible to start a project without npm init
only it will not have package.json file included
thus developer must remember, what dependencies must be installed first
instead of simply using npm install command

ts-loader probably still have to be manually linked...

after having webpack installed, having tsc --watch running is pointless
since webpack not only will transpile the .ts files to .js
but will also create the bundle
